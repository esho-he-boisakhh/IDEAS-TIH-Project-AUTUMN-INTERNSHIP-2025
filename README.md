House Price Prediction (India) using Regression Models

This project demonstrates the application of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and regression modeling on a housing dataset from India. It aims to predict property prices based on various housing features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, grade, and more.


**Objective**

Predict house prices using linear regression based on relevant housing features.

Identify key features influencing property prices.

Apply real-world data preprocessing techniques including:

Handling missing values (KNN, interpolation, etc.)

Correlation analysis

Feature engineering

Evaluate model performance using MSE and RÂ² Score.


**Tools and Technologies**

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab (for development and execution)


**Key Features Implemented**

Synthetic missing value injection and multiple imputation methods

Feature selection using correlation threshold > 0.6

Pairplot & heatmap visualizations

Multiple missing value handling strategies

Train-test splitting

Regression modeling and predictions

Comparative model on diabetes dataset
